### Bitwise Calculator: A Powerful Text-Based Calculator for Technical Users

## Overview

Bitwise is an elegant, text-based calculator designed for technical professionals who need more than just basic arithmetic. Inspired by applications like Numi, it combines the simplicity of a notepad with the power of a scientific calculator, creating a seamless workflow where calculations and documentation live side by side.

## The Vision

Bitwise aims to be the go-to calculation tool for engineers, developers, scientists, and students who regularly work with complex calculations. Unlike traditional calculators that only show one calculation at a time, Bitwise presents a document-like interface where you can build a narrative of calculations, maintaining context and history as you work through problems.

## User Experience

When you open Bitwise, you're greeted with a clean, distraction-free interface split into two panels:

- **Left Panel**: A text editor where you type your calculations, notes, and variable assignments
- **Right Panel**: Instant results that update as you type, aligned with each line of input


The dark-themed interface (with light mode option) is designed for extended use, reducing eye strain during long calculation sessions. The monospaced font ensures perfect alignment of mathematical expressions and results.

## Key Features

### Natural Language Calculations

Bitwise understands calculations written in a natural, intuitive syntax. You can write expressions like:

```plaintext
1.25 + 3.5
90 + 144.25
sin(90) + 3.5(sin(144.25))
```

And see the results instantly appear on the right side.

### Variables and References

You can define variables and reference them in subsequent calculations:

```plaintext
x = 10
y = 20
x + y
x * y
```

This makes it easy to explore "what-if" scenarios by changing a variable and watching all dependent calculations update automatically.

### Rich Mathematical Functions

Bitwise supports a comprehensive set of mathematical operations:

- **Basic arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- **Trigonometric functions**: sin, cos, tan with support for both degrees and radians
- **Advanced math**: Square roots, logarithms, exponents, absolute values
- **Special operators**: Like the parallel resistance operator (||) that calculates the equivalent resistance of parallel resistors


### Unit Conversions

The calculator handles unit conversions seamlessly:

```plaintext
5 km to miles
150 lbs to kg
2.5 hours to minutes
```

This eliminates the need to switch between different tools when working with mixed units.

### Angle Mode Toggle

For trigonometric calculations, you can switch between degrees and radians with a simple toggle in the status bar, making it flexible for different types of problems.

## Use Cases

Engineers can use Bitwise to:

- Calculate circuit parameters
- Solve mechanics problems
- Perform structural analysis calculations
- Convert between different unit systems


### Financial Planning

Financial professionals can:

- Calculate compound interest
- Perform loan amortization
- Analyze investment returns
- Convert between currencies

### Education

Students and educators can:

- Solve homework problems
- Explore mathematical concepts
- Create step-by-step solution guides
- Share calculation workflows


## The Bitwise Difference

What sets Bitwise apart from other calculators is its seamless blend of documentation and calculation. As you work, you're not just getting answersâ€”you're building a living document that captures your thought process. This makes it invaluable for:

- Documenting complex calculations for future reference
- Sharing calculation workflows with colleagues
- Exploring alternative scenarios by adjusting variables
- Creating calculation templates for repeated tasks


The calculator remembers your variables throughout your session, allowing you to build complex models step by step. The ability to include comments alongside calculations helps document assumptions and methodology.

## Philosophy

Bitwise embodies a philosophy that calculation should be:

- **Transparent**: See all your steps and assumptions
- **Contextual**: Understand calculations in their full context
- **Fluid**: Easily modify inputs and see results update
- **Documented**: Capture the why, not just the what of calculations


By bringing together the best aspects of spreadsheets, programming, and calculators, Bitwise creates a unique tool that enhances productivity and clarity in technical work.
